**The TeachFi Network** is a blockchain-powered educational ecosystem that brings together schools, families, teachers, and investors to reshape education through decentralization. Built on the MultiversX blockchain, TeachFi uses smart contracts, tokenized economies, and transparent governance to:
- Fund and grow schools through a franchise model.
- Empower students with tools like NFTs, staking, and entrepreneurship platforms.
- Reward teachers and incentivize academic performance through automated scholarships and token bonuses.
- Let parents actively participate by tracking tuition, marks, attendance, and progress via a dedicated app.
- Expand globally, offering its educational platform to any school - public or private - for a fixed fee in LEARN tokens.

You can split the TeachFi ecosystem in two modules: financial (DAO, Launchpad, Franchise DAO, DEX, Staking) and educational (Platform, NFT Marketplace, Test Launchpad, Test DEX, Test Staking).

The financial module powers the economic and governance engine of the TeachFi Network. It enables fundraising, decentralized decision-making, token management, and liquidity flows across the ecosystem.
- DAO: The central treasury and voting mechanism where LEARN token holders govern fund allocations and franchise launches.
- Launchpad: A fundraising platform for launching franchise tokens and onboarding new schools.
- Franchise DAO: Local smart contracts that manage each school’s operations, salaries, and token-based economy.
- DEX: A decentralized exchange for trading LEARN and franchise tokens against USDC.
- Staking: Enables users to stake tokens for rewards, promoting long-term ecosystem engagement.

The educational module is the interactive learning hub for students and schools. It introduces Web3 tools to education, encouraging creativity, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship.
- Educational Platform: A customizable interface for learning, accessible by any school globally for a fixed fee in LEARN.
- NFT Marketplace: A space for students to mint and sell creative digital assets.
- Test Launchpad: A simulated business builder where students can launch tokenized projects.
- Test DEX: A sandbox exchange for students to trade their test tokens in a risk-free environment.
- Test Staking: Teaches economic principles by allowing students to stake mock tokens and earn simulated rewards.

TeachFi is not just a project - it’s a movement to decentralize, democratize, and modernize education for the Web3 era.
