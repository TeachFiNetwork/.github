The TeachFi Network is a blockchain-powered educational ecosystem that brings together schools, families, teachers, and investors to reshape education through decentralization. Built on the MultiversX blockchain, TeachFi uses smart contracts, tokenized economies, and transparent governance to:

- Fund and grow schools through a franchise model.
- Empower students with tools like NFTs, staking, and entrepreneurship platforms.
- Reward teachers and incentivize academic performance through automated scholarships and token bonuses.
- Let parents actively participate by tracking tuition, marks, attendance, and progress via a dedicated app.
- Expand globally, offering its educational platform to any school - public or private - for a fixed fee in LEARN tokens.

TeachFi is not just a project - itâ€™s a movement to decentralize, democratize, and modernize education for the Web3 era.
